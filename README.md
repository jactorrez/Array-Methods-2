## Array Methods 2
### Working with some, every, find, and findIndex

A small, and fun, project from the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. To start off the new year, I wanted to dive deeper into Javascript by learning and using the new and more advanced (and sometimes obscure!) syntax introduced in ES6 in small projects. In the process I also wanted to get more familiar with vanilla Javascript. There's no better way to start than with the \#Javascript30 challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects in 30 days.

This project is/was similar to the "Array Methods" project, though with different methods. A small/short project, but working with arrays and array methods is always fun.
